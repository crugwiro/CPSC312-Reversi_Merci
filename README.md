# CPSC312-Reversi_Merci
CPCS 312 project
The Reversi game begins with the state of an 8x8 board containg 4 chips in the center. 2 of these chips are black and 2 are white, and the chips of opposite colours are placed diagonal to one another. This game is typically played with one player against another. The basic rule is that each player has to place their chip of a certain colour next to a chip on the board of the other colour. All chips that are sandwiched between a chip of the player's colour must flip to be that colour. The primary goal of a Reversi player is to finish with the majority of the chips on the board being their colour.
